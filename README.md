Implementation of some basic models (not call to high-level toolkit, but low-level implementation).

## Structure
- machine_learning : such as SVM/LR/etc.
- deep_learning : such as LSTM/CNN/ResNet/etc.
- reinforcement_learning : such as TD/actor-critic/etc.
- hot : recent popular work such as MLP/transformer/FPN/etc.
- misc : miscellaneous algorithms such as viterbi/etc.

## Checklist
- [x] Compressive Sensing : IRLS, OMP, IHT
- [x] Logistic Regression & Softmax Regression
- [ ] Hidden Markov Model
- [ ] Support Vector Machine
- [ ] Radial Basis Function
- [ ] Expectation-Maximization
- [ ] waiting for more...

## Note
For simple algos like CS(compressive sensing)/LR(logistic regression)/etc.:\
The configuration is simply set in the code file as global attributes.\
For complex algos like RNN/CNN/etc.:\
The configuration is set in the .conf file or .yaml file.
