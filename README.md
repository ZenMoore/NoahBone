# NoahBone
Realization of some key models, or rather the common backbones.

## Structure
- ML-based : machine learning methods such as SVM/LR/etc.
- DL-based : deep learning methods such as LSTM/CNN/etc.
- RL-based : reinforcement learning methods such as TD/actor-critic/etc.
- hotspot : recent popular work such as MLP/transformer/MoCo/etc.

## Checklist
- [ ] Compressive Sensing
- [ ] waiting for more...

## About
[ZenMoore@BUAA](github.com/ZenMoore) is a junior, supervised by Prof. Zhoujun Li.<br>
This project is to exercise my own code ability, so as to adapt to the follow-up research and development work, and hope to be made public as a library of collection.
